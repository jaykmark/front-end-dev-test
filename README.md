## Technologies Used
Bootstrap for its grid system. SlickJS for the carousel. AnimateCSS for fade in effects.

## Development Process
I wasn't too familiar with webpacks so I spent a lot of time learning the fundamentals. I ran into roadblocks when trying to link my files for web deployment.

I enjoyed learning SCSS and BEM naming conventions. It allowed me to write clean, scalable code. 

  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
  3. What you enjoyed the most and why
