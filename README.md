## Technologies Used
Bootstrap for its grid system. SlickJS for the carousel. AnimateCSS for fade in effects.

## Development Process
I wasn't too familiar with webpack so I spent a lot of time learning the fundamentals. I ran into roadblocks when trying to link my files for web deployment.

I enjoyed learning SCSS and BEM naming conventions. It allowed me to write clean, scalable code.
